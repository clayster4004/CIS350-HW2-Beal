# Clay Beal
* I enjoy running and going to the gym
* I like computer hardware, including designing and building computers
* I really enjoy watching YouTube
## Technical Background
I have been programming for about 2 years, pretty much exclusively in python. This is my 
first class outside of CIS162 and CIS163. I have spent a lot of time delving into 
computer hardware which has always been an interest of mine. I have build / fixed a 
lot of computers and do so mainly as a hobby.
